# JavaEE Flyway Integration

A sample application that integrates [Flyway](https://flywaydb.org) with a JavaEE Application.

I use
a [Payara Micro Community Edition](https://www.payara.fish/products/payara-platform-community/)
server. But it can be ported to any JavaEE server with almost no extra work. Just remove the payara
dependencies from `pom.xml`.

I have also written a [blog](https://varij.dev/javaee-flyway-db-inntegration) about how to configure
the app.
